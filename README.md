# Atlas Travel Foundation
The foundation is a Topeka-based organization established in 2024 to support academic study abroad through travel scholarships to eligible Shawnee County Students.

This Github Pages account will serve as a temporary base for the Foundation website as we build. 

The file "index.md" contains the content for the home page. 

There will also be an "index.md" file inside the folder for any other main pages. 

This site is built using markdown, which is a text-based editing format. [Here is a great markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet).
