| #Messaging and Tone |
| The Atlas Travel Foundation believes travel is exciting, broadens the mind, and shows us that the world is both large and small at the same time.  Messaging should underscore the ability for travel to change how we approach the world, while the tone should emphasize feelings of joy, awe, and wonder travel creates. |
